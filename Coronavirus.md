My first try at doing anything in python during pandemic. Code basically takes stats from website and checks if it have been written in excel spreadshhet. Then it gets all data it has at the moment and calculates different approximations uisng Scipy. Then makes a couple graphs on matplotlib and sends them with text to vk.com messages
